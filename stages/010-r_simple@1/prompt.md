Goal: Add z.ai GLM5.3 and GLM5.3 Flash support. Understand the provider model for the models

Notes:
- Use precedent for changing default model
- Implement in openrouter and others as well
- Research the pricing yourself

**First, get the change in front of you.** Nothing has been handed to you, so
find it yourself:

    git --no-pager diff origin/main...HEAD

If `origin/main` does not resolve, use `main` instead. Read whole files with
`git show` or by opening them whenever the diff alone is not enough to judge —
a diff hides the context a line sits in, and most real defects live in that
context.

You are reviewing only. Do not edit, create, or delete any file, and do not
commit. Three other reviewers are working in this same checkout at the same
time, and a write from you would corrupt what they are reading.

Review the change for unnecessary complexity only.

Look for: abstraction with a single caller, configuration nobody sets, dead or
unreachable code, duplicated logic that already exists elsewhere in this
repository, indirection that makes the change harder to follow, and scope the
change added beyond what the goal asked for.

For each finding say what to delete or collapse, and what the simpler version
looks like.

Do not report style preferences, formatting, or naming you merely dislike. Only
report complexity that will cost a future reader real time.

If the diff is appropriately simple, say so plainly.
